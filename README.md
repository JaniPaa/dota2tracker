## This application is intended to keep track on your own and other peoples Dota 2 games and to give info and tips about the game.

## To get your own Dota 2 games data you are going to need your steamID to be able to get them from the Dota API.

When registering an account for Dota2tracker you are going to need to create username, password and if you have a steam account you can link your steamID too so that you can automatically see your own Dota 2 games in the "My stats" page.


### This project is currently in progress.
